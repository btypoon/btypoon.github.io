        <p>Dear Ophelia Leung,</p>
        <p> By the time you have received this gift, we have probably departed from each other. Please don’t hate me for my selfishness. Please don’t be mad at me for not talking to you anymore. Please, please do remember all the good times we had
          together.</p>
        <p> I knew from the beginning that you weren’t interested in me. I knew beforehand that you had a history of flirting with boys. I knew from the start that I was just one of your boys. I still chose to get to know you. I still chose to answer
          your messages and calls. I still chose to fall for you. </p>
        <p> I still can’t get over the fact that you kept looking for me every day. You messaged me daily since the day we met. You chose to play apex with me, a game that you hated before we met. You asked me to watch movies with you. You talked to
          me about your daily life. You looked for me even though I went invisible. You called me frequently. I don’t want to believe that you were not interested in me. I don’t want to accept that I am just a “friend” to you. I don’t want to admit
          that you didn’t like me.</p>
        <p> Therefore, I kept asking you questions like “do you miss me?”, “do you like me?”. I wanted you to say yes. I wanted to confirm that we were fond of each other. I am sorry, I got so immersed that I didn’t realize I was giving you pressure.
          I didn’t notice I was hurting you. I never wanted to hurt you.</p>
        <p> Later, I got so broken and tired of one-sided love that I wanted to give up a couple of times. On the one side of my head, I miss you so much. On the other side of my head, I want to move on and forget about you. I wanted you to let me
          let you go. I wanted you to give me a reason to leave you. I wanted to hear from you that “You don’t like me”. Therefore, I kept asking you questions. I was so into my own head I didn’t realize how frustrated I put you into. </p>
        <p> I could never say no to you. I could never be the one who asks for the end of our “relationship”. I couldn’t do it myself. So, When you asked me to be kept being friend with you on the day I confessed to you, or on the day I made you cry,
          I couldn’t say no. Both times, I wanted to leave once and for all. But deep down, I don’t want us to end.</p>
        <p> After I recognized how much I hurt you, I cried a lot. I knew I couldn’t be with you no more. I cannot accept myself for such action. I guess the tug of war in my head between missing you and wanting to forget you was concluded. I became
          emotionless afterwards. I lost interest in everything, even you. Suddenly, I don’t miss you no more. I can’t feel any emotion anymore. I can’t smile, I can’t be sad, I can’t be angry, nothing. I felt nothing from any love song. I don’t want
          to believe that I no longer liked you. I can’t accept that overnight, I don’t love you no more. It does not sound logical to me. I am 100% certain that I loved you before. I think that every time I cried for you, something broke within me.
          I got so broken that I lost my emotion. </p>
        <p> I still remember many days I wanted to chat with you, I wanted to call you, I wanted my game to end asap so that we could talk to each other in private chat. Later, you began to open yourself up, I was so happy hear from you wanting to
          chat with me. I felt genuinely happy that we both wanted to chat with each other, as if we wanted each other.</p>
        <p> I told you that I like you for your positivity, your energy, and your radiance. You shine in my eyes. You have everything I wished for, happiness and a lovely family. I mentioned that I was sad my whole life because of my family issue, I
          never showed it. Also, I was wrong that I can’t see those properties when you were “with me”. I could find them when you talked to your family. When you yell at them, I felt it. I felt warmth. I always wished to have a positive talkative
          mother-like women by my side. My type of girls are “Rem from ReZero”, “ Rebecca from EdgeRunner”, or “Kaori from Your Lie In April”. What in common are their initiative to care, their intelligent in knowing how a men felt deep down behind
          his mask. I don’t see much intelligence in you (XD) but I guess if you were to look into my eyes, you could notices it too.</p>
        <p> I haven’t cried for a girl in over ten years. I haven’t liked anyone for who knows how long. You became my significant other. There will always be a special place for you in my life from now on. Those three weeks felt like three years for
          me. I felt everything, from beginning to the end. I don’t think I am capable of loving another person anytime soon. But I will get pass that, because I promised.</p>
        <p> Personality-wise, you are really perfect to me. I wanted to gift you the BMO plush, I want you to remember the good times we had had together. I wanted October of 2023 to be one of the best memories you had in your life. I wanted you to
          remember me. I wanted us to depart with a good note, good feeling, good smile.</p>
        <p> I wrote a poem at the end of the first week of October 2023 when I felt super jealous, broken, and in loved. The poem was written on my steam profile. I don’t think you have seen it before because I hided it under “View more info” button.
          Please do have a look afterward. Writing helped me to express my feelings. The poem represented my feeling to you for the first week.</p>
        <p> Please let me let you go this time. Please, don’t hold me back this time. Don’t ask me to be your “friend” no more. There is no way for me to be your friend knowing that I like you and I can’t be with you. Please be good. Please don’t be
          sad because it’s over. Please, be happy because it happened.</p>
        <p> Once loved,<br> Burton Poon </p>

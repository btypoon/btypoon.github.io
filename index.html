          I graduated from the University of Hong Kong in 2022 with a major in
          Physics and theme of Astronomy. In late Febeurary 2023, I started my
          first job as a research asistant at the Education University of Hong
          Kong. I have been continue working in the University ever since.
        </p>

          As a physics student, we all went through a rigorous journey of
          mathematical training. Started with basic algebra and geometry.
          Gradually progressed to more advanced topics like calculus,
          differential equations and complex numbers. Eventually moved beyond
          Newtonian mechanics to the more abstract Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
          formulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of mastering abstract concepts and complex theories, we
          believed we were finally ready to apply for a job in the society.
          Surely, that must be the purpose of our education system given the way
          they trained us. But ironically, when you finally get a real job in
          the real world, shall you realize all we need is Excel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I work on creating Physics simulations for public
          educational use. I aimed to design creative, interactive and fun
          experiements for children to learn Physics on. Break away from
          traditional, rigid teaching methods that rely on rote memorization and
          passive learning. Instead, we should encourage exploration, creativity
          and sense of discovery. Making Physics study enjoyable and memorable.

          <b>&#8220; I should write a personal blog &#8221;</b> I told myself. I
          am a forgetful person, I once read the same Mathematic textbook three
          times and still could not remember the content when I needed it. Maybe
          it was because I did not get to use any of them. After all, how can we
          reinforce knowledge if we do not get to practice it? Therefore, I need
          to write them down. To remind myself what I have learnt, lest I
          forget.

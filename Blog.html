          <p>I was asked to help create a rolling ball track for the deomonstration of Energy Conservation targeting primary school students. The ideal creation was to make a mini version of <em>Energy Machine</em> from Space Museum. </p>

            <h3>Attempt on making a marble track</h3>
            <p>Orignally, I was going to follow the youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPguktA674w">How to make a STEEL MARBLE TRACK with basic tools! step by step guide</a> by Daniel de Bruin. I was able to follow everything in
              the video until the soldering step. For any reason, the soldering material was not sticking onto the metal wires. I tried both Iron and Copper wires. Therefore, I could not connect the tracks together and I am forces to gave up on
              making a metal verison. </p>
            <p>To compromise, a paper version of the ball tracks was made folowing this tutorial <a href="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/stem-activities/paper-roller-coaster">Build a Paper Roller Coaster</a> from Science Buddy. This one was easy
              enough to make. I ended up making a A4 template in Krita for easy printing.</p>

          <p>I was asked to revise an powerpoint from 2018 with the up-to-date data. The powerpoint was titled "What are Scientists". It talked about the study and work opportunities for science students in Hong Kong. It referenced data of enrolment
            ratio for UGC funded programmes by categories from the Hong Kong Annual Digest of Statistics. It referenced STEM works distribution, requirement and education level from the United State. It referenced up-to-date Universities ranking.</p>

          <p>Multiple times I was asked to process the data collected from different questionaire. Average scores on each question were calculated, and input into a form. Due to the repetitive works, I decided to write Python program to automatic the
            task.</p>
          <p>This program automatically take the raw data from excel, calculated the average score and output them into a neatly organaized table.</p>

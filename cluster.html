          To connect to the server, you must first connected to the university
          intranet. You may use either:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wifi <span class="inlineCode">EdUHK</span></li>
          <li>Wifi <span class="inlineCode">IoT</span></li>
          <li>Wired university computer</li>
          <li>EdUHK VPN</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use any ssh software of your choice such as
          <i>PuTTY</i> or window terminal. You can connect to either of the
          following IP addresses via
          <span class="inlineCode">ssh</span> command:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="inlineCode">ssh phys.eduhk.hk</span></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Enter your username and password when prompted. A quick way to connect
          the server with a specific username is to use
          <span class="inlineCode">ssh username@IP</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          When connected successfully, you will be greeted by the following

          Currently, to add a new user, we need to repeats the command

          We are looking for a solution to add a new user on all computer by
          running the commands once
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe, there is a way to synchronize the user data on all computers.
          Or one might write a script to automatically create a new user with
          the necessary credential information on all computers in one go

          Problem 2: Unable to create or modify files in all Slave computers for
          new user <br /><span class="datetime">5-July-2023</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our new user Thomas Ho cannot run program or make any changes in all
          slaves computers but bill01. Older account does not have this problem
        </p>
        <h3>Located Cause</h3>
        <p>
          The problem was that the system treated the user from other host
          (slave1-5) as "other user" instead of "owner" although they have the
          same username. Therefore, after I allowed write permission for "other
          user" in the directory, the problem was solved. However, "other user"
          including user other then the user with the same name as the owner can
          also modify the file inside now
        </p>
        <h3>Suggested solution</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Giving him admin privilege such that he can use sudo command.
            Downside was that he gain access to other admin command
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable write permission for all users in Thomas's home folder.
            Downside was that every other user can write file to his home
            folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another solution is to allow specific group of user to access the
            folder by their group ID. However, as I dig through the file, I
            found another problem. The group id for the groups of same name in
            bill01 and slave1-5 computers were different.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
          New problem: Different group id for same user across all computers
        </h3>
        <img width="300" src="image\problem1.jpg" alt="" />
        <figcaption>
          The image display the defined groups in bill01 (left), slave1(middle)
          and slave2(right) from /etc/groups.
        </figcaption>
        <p>
          The word represents the group name and the number represent the group
          id. Each user was assigned a group id when created. Files recognize
          permitted user by their group id. For example, my group id was 1017 in
          bill01 and 1016 in slave1-5.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the home folder was created in bill01, it permitted users of
          group id 1017 to write and modify in it. However, my group id was 1016
          in slave's computer. Therefore, even if I allowed write permission for
          the group of ID 1017, I cannot write in my home folder in slave's
          computers . To make it works, I would need to fix the mismatches of
          group id in bill01 and slave1-5. Therefore I suggest simply making the
          user home's folder writable for all user, which is what I did.
        </p>
        <p>

          Problem 4: Security reported three critical vulnerabilities
          <br /><span class="datetime">11-Jul-2025</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          According to the Tenable Security Report provided by the OCIO, three
          vulnerabilities had been identified on the Physics Laboratory's
          Server:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Canonical Ubuntu Linux SEoL (16.04.x) - Critical Severity</li>
          <li>
            SSH Terrapin Prefix Truncation Weakness (CVE-2023-48795) - High
            Severity
          </li>
          <li>ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure - Low Severity</li>
        </ol>
        <section>
          <h3>First vulnerability</h3>
          <p>
            Regarding the first critical vulnerability, our server was running
            Ubuntu version 16.04, which reached its end-of-life in 2021 and was
            no longer supported by the Official. Upgrading the operating system
            to a supported and up-to-date version will effectively resolve this
            issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Ubuntu does not support a direct upgrade from version 16.04
            to the latest release, 24.04. Instead, the upgrade must be performed
            incrementally from 16.04 → 18.04 → 20.04 → 22.04 → 24.04.
          </p>
          <p>For each upgrade step, the following commands must be executed:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
sudo do-release-upgrade
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            The upgrade process must be repeated for each of the seven computers
            in our server cluster, marking a total of 28 OS upgrades. This made
            the overall effort very time-consuming.
          </p>
          <p>
            To check the current OS version, one may use the following commands
            for version before 18.04:
            <span class="command">lsb_release -a</span>
            and after 20.04:
            <span class="command">cat /etc/os/release</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            During the upgrade process of computers <i>Bill01</i> and
            <i>master</i>, the display output was lost due to outdated graphics
            drivers that were incompatible with the newer version of Ubuntu.
          </p>
          <p>To resolve this issue, the following steps were taken:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Identifying the Graphics Card</b>
              <p>
                The following command was ran to determine the video card
                installed on the system:
                <span class="command">sudo lshw -c video</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Installing Driver Management Module (if missing)</b>
              <p>
                For machine that do not have ubuntu-drivers utility installed,
                we ran:
                <span class="command"
                  >sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common</span
                >
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Check for Available Drivers</b>
              <p>
                Using the command below, we listed any new and available
                drivers:
                <span class="command">ubuntu-drivers devices</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Installing new Drivers</b>
              <p>
                To install the new graphics drivers, we ran:
                <span class="command">sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Reboot the System</b>
              <p>
                After installation, we rebooted the system to apply the
                changes:<span class="command">sudo reboot</span>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Afterwards, the display functionality was restored and the upgrade
            process can be continued.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the upgrade process of computers <i>Slave1-5</i>, all
            encountered the error:
            <span class="inlineCode"
              >"Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)"</span
            >, preventing them from being upgradable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Extensive testing showed the issue stemmed from many conflicting and
            corrupted packages presented on each of the affected computers.
            Resolving the problem involved either removing or reinstalling the
            problematic packages, which successfully restored the upgrade
            functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterward, type command
            <span class="command">sudo dpkg --configure -a </span> to fix
            package installation issue
          </p>

          <h3>Second vulnerability</h3>
          <p>
            Regarding the second high-severity vulnerability, it was identified
            that the cryptographic algorithms currently utilized by our SSH
            server were considered insecure and potentially susceptible to
            exploitation. Specifically, the following six algorithms were
            flagged:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</li>
            <li>umac-64-etm@openssh.com</li>
            <li>umac-128-etm@openssh.com</li>
            <li>hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com</li>
            <li>hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com</li>
            <li>hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to either disabled
            or replaced these algorithms with more secure alternatives.
            Disabling them should be sufficient to resolve the issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do that, edit the
            <span class="inlineCode">sshd_config</span> file by command

            <span class="command"> sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config </span>
            and append the following code to the end of file
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">
# Disable Ciphers List
Ciphers -chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

#Enable MACs List

          </code></pre>
          <p>
            For unknown reason, multiple exclusions was not working. Only the
            first one in the list was disabled. User can still connect via other
            listed MACs algorithm. Therefore, we used explicit inclusion list
            and avoided using exclusion list for MACs.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">
# Disable MACs List
MACs -umac-64-etm@openssh.com,-umac-128-etm@openssh.com,-hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,-hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,-hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            To list all available Ciphers and MACs supported by OpenSSH, use
            <span class="inlineCode">ssh -Q mac</span> and
            <span class="inlineCode">ssh -Q cipher</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            To verify the whether the cryptographic algorithms were disabled,
            specify the algorithms used in ssh connection. For example:
            <span class="command"
              >ssh -c chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com user@ip</span
            >
            <span class="command">ssh -m umac-64-etm@openssh.com user@ip</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Implementing these modifications is expected to resolve the second
            high-severity vulnerability.

          <h3>Third vulnerability</h3>
          <p>
            For the third vulnerability, the server maintenance technician
            should Block ICMP Timestamp Requests at the Firewall. Require
            someone familiar with Linus operating systems to access and modify
            the firewall setting.

          Problem 5: SSH Connection failure
          <br /><span class="datetime">11-Jul-2025</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          While upgrading the Operating system of the server, there was a period
          during which the SSH service became inaccessible. A thorough and
          extensive investigation revealed that two wired network connections
          were conflicting, resulting in a mismatch between the static public IP
          address provided by OCIO and the dynamic public IP address assigned by
          our router. It hints a potential problem that might recur in future
          upgrades. For reference, the steps we took were logged below.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Mismatch between public IPs</h3>
          <p>
            When runing <span class="inlineCode">hostname -I</span> and
            <span class="inlineCode">curl ifconfig.me</span>, different public
            IPs were returned. Our server although connected to the static IP
            network, was not using it as its public IP. Hence, connection via
            static IP, <span class="inlineCode">ssh 175.159.131.248</span>, was
            not working.
          </p>
          <p>
            One may temporarily forward port 22 on the router via its setting
            page at <span class="inlineCode">192.168.1.1</span> with the
            password <span class="inlineCode">billyeung</span>. And enable
            listening on incoming connection from all IPs by editing the
            <span class="inlineCode">sshd_config</span> file:
            <span class="command">sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</span>
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">
ListenAddress ::
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
            </code></pre>
          <p>
            Then, use the dynamic public IP assigned by the router to ssh
            connect the server. As of 10-7-2025, SSH connection was temporarily
            reestablished using the dynamic IP,
            <span class="inlineCode">ssh 175.159.139.164</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the ssh service is still unavailable, one may check and restart
            its status using
            <span class="command">sudo systemctl status ssh</span>
            <span class="command">sudo systemctl restart ssh</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Check also the firewall to see if connection via port 22 was
            allowed. Allow ssh in the firewall if needed.
            <span class="command">sudo ufw status</span>
            <span class="command">sudo ufw allow ssh</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, one may continue working on the server remotely via the
            dynamic ip address.

          <h3>Cause and Replication steps</h3>
          <figure>
            <img width="450" src="image\cluster\network_setting.jpg" alt="" />
            <figcaption>
              (Top) Ethernet <i>enp0s25</i> refers to the static IP network.
              (Bottom) Ethernet <i>ens1</i> refers to the dynamic IP network.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Extensive investigation revealed that the computer was connected to
            two different networks. The Ethernet interface
            <i>enp0s25</i> connected the computer <i>bill01</i> to the external
            internet, while the Ethernet interface <i>ens1</i> linked
            <i>bill01</i> to the internal intranet, allowing its communication
            and access with the other six computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The order in which the network interfaces were connected affected
            the computer’s public IP address. When the network <i>ens1</i> was
            connected first, bill01 use the dynamic public IP address assigned
            by the router as its public IP address. When the network
            <i>enp0s25</i> was connected first, bill01 use the static public IP
            address assigned by OCIO as its public IP address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, we should always click the <i>enp0s25</i> button first,
            then the <i>ens1</i> button secondly. It was confirmed that the
            static IP address, the SSH service, and the firewall were all
            functioning correctly. The issue stemmed solely from the sequence of
            network connections, which altered the public IP address and led to
            SSH connection failures.

        <p>
          After OS upgrade, the local IP address assigned by our router might
          changed. Therefore, SSH connection between computers like
          <span class="inlineCode">ssh master</span> fails. The system will try
          to refer and connect you to the old local IP which no longer exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check the latest local IP on each computer using either command
          <span class="inlineCode">ip a</span> or command
          <span class="inlineCode">ifconfig</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also connect to the router webpage via

        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, update the file
